# American-Express-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and consumers, as it results in financial losses and damages to reputation. The traditional rule-based systems for fraud detection have limitations in detecting new and evolving fraud patterns, as they rely on pre-defined rules and thresholds, which may not be effective in identifying complex fraud patterns. Therefore, there is a need for ML-based fraud detection models that can effectively detect fraudulent activities in real-time while minimising false positives and false negatives.
The ML-based fraud detection for credit card fraud aims to develop and maintain models that can identify fraudulent activities by analysing various data sources, including transaction data, user behaviour, and contextual data. These models should be able to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and detect anomalies that are indicative of fraudulent activities. Additionally, the models should address the imbalanced data problem, as the majority of credit card transactions are legitimate, which can result in high false positive rates.

To address these challenges, the ML-based fraud detection models should incorporate advanced algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, and random forests, to analyse the data and identify fraudulent activities. Furthermore, the models should be regularly updated with new data and feedback from experts to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.

In conclusion, effective credit card fraud detection can be achieved by developing and maintaining ML-based fraud detection models that can detect evolving fraud patterns in real-time while minimising false positives and false negatives.
